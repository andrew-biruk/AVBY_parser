1) Instructions to **AVBY_parser.py**

Use "parse_av_lxml" or "parse_av_bs" for parsing on LXML or BeautifulSoup.
Use "write_json_csv" to create JSON and CSV files in project directory.

2) Instructions to **CSVJSON_reader.py**

Use "pretty_print" to print CSV/JSON as well readable table.
NOTE: "PrettyTable" library is required (see https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/ for details).
Use "regular_print" to print CSV/JSON with standard methods of csv/json modules.


**UPD:**
Added asynchronous parser (faster 8-10 times).
